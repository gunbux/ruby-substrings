<h2>Assignment Review</h2>
<p>Time taken: Under 2 hours over 2 days</p>
<p>Rushed into the problem without reading the full specification; missed out the specification for the method to work on sentences as well as words. Had to split that task into a seperate method itself, but overall quite straightforward and little to no problems solving this.</p>
